# HandsOnConcurrency — Practice-First Java Concurrency for SDE2 Interviews

> **AI-Generated Repository**: This project was created with AI assistance.

Master Java concurrency through **hands-on practice**. This repository provides skeleton code for common interview problems — you implement the solutions.

---

## 📚 Learning Philosophy

This repo follows a **practice-first** approach:

1. **Solve before seeing solutions** — Problem skeletons are separate from canonical solutions
2. **Learn from common mistakes** — Each problem documents typical errors to avoid
3. **Test your implementation** — Run tests to validate your solution
4. **Compare with reference** — Only after solving, check the `solutions/` package

> 💡 **The struggle is where learning happens.** Resist the urge to peek at solutions early!

## JCiP Chapter Mapping

This repository is designed to be a companion to **"Java Concurrency in Practice" (JCiP)**, modernized for **Java 17+**.

| Module | JCiP Chapters | Modern Focus |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| **01: Foundations** | Ch 2, 3, 4, 16 | Records, Sealed Classes, JMM |
| **02: Locks/Atomics** | Ch 5, 13, 15 | StampedLock, Synchronizers |
| **03: Executors/Async**| Ch 6, 8 | CompletableFuture, Fork/Join |
| **04: Liveness/Prod** | Ch 7, 10 | Shutdown Hooks, Thread Dumps |
| **05: Testing** | Ch 12 | Stress Tests, Correctness |
| **06: Classic Problems**| Part I & IV | Interview Patterns |
| **07: Capstone** | Part II & III | System Design |
| **08: LLD + Concurrency**| Part II | Object Composition |
| **09: Debugging** | Ch 10, 11 | Anti-patterns |
| **10: Evolution** | Ch 15 | CAS, Lock-free vs Locking |

## 🚀 How to Use This Repo

### For Learning (Recommended)

1. **Pick a module** — Start with `module1-foundations` if new to concurrency
2. **Read the module README** — Understand learning objectives
3. **Open a skeleton file** — Read the problem statement and TODO comments
4. **Implement your solution** — Don't look at solutions yet!
5. **Run tests** — Validate your implementation
6. **Compare with solution** — Learn from the reference implementation

### For Interview Prep (Fast Track)

Focus on `module6-classic-problems` — these are the most commonly asked:

| Priority | Problem | Concepts Tested |
|----------|---------|-----------------|
| 1 | Bounded Blocking Queue | wait/notify, state machine |
| 2 | Token Bucket Rate Limiter | Time management, lazy-fill |
| 3 | Thread-Safe LRU Cache | Fine-grained locking, CHM |
| 4 | Custom Thread Pool | Worker pattern, BlockingQueue |
| 5 | Dining Philosophers | Deadlock prevention |

## 🔧 In-Code Comment Guide

All skeleton files use these markers:

| Marker | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `// TODO:` | What you need to implement |
| `// ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES:` | Typical errors to avoid |
| `// 💡 THINK:` | Consider alternative approaches |
| `// ⚠️ AVOID:` | Anti-patterns to reject |
| `// 📝 NOTE:` | Important concepts |

---

## 🏢 LLD + Concurrency Problems

These combine OOP class design with thread-safety — exactly what SDE2 interviews test:

| Problem | Concurrency Challenge | Similar To |
|---------|----------------------|------------|
| **Seat Booking System** | Prevent double-booking (CAS) | BookMyShow, movie tickets |
| **Parking Lot** | Multiple gates, atomic allocation | Classic LLD problem |
| **Pub-Sub System** | Concurrent publishers/subscribers | Mini-Kafka, event systems |

Contributions welcome! Please maintain the **practice-first** philosophy:
- Problem skeletons should NOT contain solution logic
- Solutions go in separate `solutions/` package
- Include common mistakes to help learners
