In total, there were 5 rounds of interviews evaluating various skills as mentioned in each round below:

👉 Round 1 - Phone Screen (45 minutes): This round included two coding problems, focusing on basic arithmetic operations on strings and identifying frequent elements. The interviewer was friendly, and I completed both questions comfortably, despite some very subtle feedback points I later realized.

👉 Round 2 - Onsite Coding (DSA) Round (60 minutes): This coding round involved two problems focused on array manipulation and expression evaluation. I faced challenges due to a rude interviewer and constant interruptions, which impacted my performance. I completed the first question fully but made mistakes in the second one.

👉 Round 3 - AI-Enabled Round (45 minutes): This round, which was completely new to me, focused on a string-processing problem that involved debugging existing code and then implementing a function to filter words based on shared letters. The interviewer was extremely friendly and helpful, which made the round feel much better.

👉 Round 4 - Product Architecture Round (60 minutes): This round focused on designing a newsfeed or Instagram-like system, including core entities, APIs, and a high-level service and database diagram. The interviewer quickly moved to follow-up questions, which seemed to confirm his understanding. The round also included several unexpected, random UI-related questions that felt outside of typical preparation.

👉 Round 5 - Behavioural Round (45 minutes): This round consisted of standard behavioral questions with follow-ups, evaluating my past experiences and how I apply leadership principles. I initially fumbled some answers due to nervousness, as the interviewer did not feel very friendly, but I recovered to answer the rest using the STAR method.
